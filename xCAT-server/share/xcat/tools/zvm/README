The prep_zxcatIVP_*.pl files are provided for each supported OpenStack release
that interacts with xCAT.  These scripts end contain the name of the OpenStack
release that they support.  The scripts scan the OpenStack configuration files
and produce a driver script which is used to validate the installation of the
OpenStack code with xCAT.  For more information on the scripts, invoke the
help function for the individual script (operand --help).
