2017-08-28 - OpenSSL Vulnerabilities
====================================

*Aug 28, 2017*, OpenSSL announced the following security advisories: https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170828.txt 


Advisory CVEs
-------------

* CVE-2017-3735 - **Malformed X.509 IPAddressFamily could cause OOB read** (Severity: Low)

If an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily extension,
OpenSSL could do a one-byte buffer overread. The most likely result
would be an erroneous display of the certificate in text format.

As this is a low severity fix, no release is being made. The fix can be
found in the source repository (1.0.2, 1.1.0, and master branches); see
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/4276. This bug has been present
since 2006.


Please see the security bulletin above for patch, upgrade, or suggested work around information.

Action
------

xCAT uses OpenSSL for client-server communication but **does not** ship it.  

It is highly recommended to keep your OpenSSL levels up-to-date with the indicated versions in the security bulletins to prevent any potential security threats. Obtain the updated software packages from your Operating system distribution channels.
